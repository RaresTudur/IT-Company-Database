# Database IT Company

This project is a database for a fictitious IT company in Oracle PL/SQL, implementing the following requirements:

1. **Briefly present the database (its usefulness)**

2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

   - Entities, relationships, and attributes are defined in Romanian.

3. **Conceptual Diagram**

   - Starting from the entity-relationship diagram, draw the conceptual diagram of the proposed model.
   - Integrate all necessary attributes, defining them in Romanian.

4. **Implement the Conceptual Diagram in Oracle**

   - Define all tables, specifying all necessary integrity constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, etc.).

5. **Add Consistent Information in the Created Tables**

   - Minimum 5 records for each independent entity.
   - Minimum 10 records for the associative table.

6. **Formulate a Problem to Solve Using an Independently Stored Subprogram**

   - Utilize all 3 types of collections studied.
   - Call the subprogram.

7. **Formulate a Problem to Solve Using an Independent Stored Subprogram**

   - Utilize 2 different types of studied cursors, one of which is a parameterized cursor dependent on the other cursor.
   - Call the subprogram.

8. **Formulate a Problem to Solve Using an Independent Stored Function Subprogram**

   - Use a stored function subprogram that utilizes 3 of the defined tables in a single SQL command.
   - Define at least 2 custom exceptions.
   - Call the subprogram to highlight all defined and treated cases.

9. **Formulate a Problem to Solve Using an Independent Stored Procedure Subprogram**

   - Use a stored procedure subprogram that utilizes 5 of the defined tables in a single SQL command.
   - Handle all possible exceptions, including NO_DATA_FOUND and TOO_MANY_ROWS.
   - Call the subprogram to highlight all treated cases.

10. **Define a Statement-Level DML Trigger**

    - Define and trigger.
    - Trigger the event.

11. **Define a Row-Level DML Trigger**

    - Define a row-level DML trigger.
    - Trigger the event.

12. **Define a DDL Trigger**

    - Define a DDL trigger.
    - Trigger the event.

13. **Define a Package Containing All Objects Defined in the Project**

    - Define a package containing all objects defined within the project.

14. **Define a Package with Complex Data Types and Objects for an Integrated Action Flow**

    - Define a package containing complex data types and objects required for an integrated action flow specific to the defined database.
    - Include at least 2 data types, 2 functions, and 2 procedures.
